                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>&emsp; &emsp;My name is Kevin Duong. I am a programmer from Wisconsin. 
                        I got into coding during my highschool years and followed the 
                        software engineering track as a hobby. Now, I am looking to dive into 
                        the world of software. I also have other hobbies, including robotics
                        and gaming. I love programming robots and watching them work. I also 
                        love playing games and figuring out how things work while also having fun.</p>
